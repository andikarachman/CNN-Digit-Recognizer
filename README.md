# Digit Recognizer Using Convolutional Neural Networks
In this notebook, we will identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN). [**MNIST handwritten digit dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) is used to train and test the CNN model.

We break this notebook into separate steps.  

* [Step 1]: Import Datasets
* [Step 2]: Specify Data Loaders for the Image Dataset
* [Step 3]: Define Model Architecture
* [Step 4]: Specify Loss Function and Optimizer
* [Step 5]: Train and Validate the Model
* [Step 6]: Test the Model
